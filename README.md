By integrating segmentation and forecasting, the company will gain both a deep understanding of its current customer base and a forward-looking view of its revenues, establishing a solid foundation for growth in a  competitive logistics market.

👷🏻‍♀️ Business Challenge
The Italian logistics sector is under intense competitive pressure, with shrinking margins and increasingly demanding customers. To address this challenge, the company needs to strengthen its understanding of the customer base and develop a forward-looking view of revenues. This project focuses on:
- analyzing customer profiles to identify who generates the most value,
- uncovering patterns and trends in purchasing behavior,
- detecting critical customers such as high-value clients at risk of churn,
- and forecasting revenues to support strategic and commercial planning.

Project Objectives
The project has four interconnected objectives. It seeks to segment and profile customers into meaningful clusters, detect recurring behavioral trends such as seasonality or regional growth, identify critical clients requiring retention strategies, and forecast monthly revenues to inform decision-making. In summary, the objectives can be described as:
Segmentation and profiling of the customer base,
Pattern and trend analysis to capture growth or decline signals,
Critical customer identification for targeted retention,
Revenue forecasting at company, sector, and regional level.
